# A Deep Dive into CNNs
***

### Week 1 | Getting Started

- To get a basic understanding what a Neural Network is, watch this excellent playlist by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) - [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi). 

- Now, to build your own Neural Network, try completing this short course by Andrew NG - [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning). You can opt for Financial aid, if you need to.

- It is sometimes overwhelming to visualise how a neural network improves its performance over time. This website will allow you to do just the same - [Neural Network Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/).   
P.S. - You might come across new terms here. Instead of just overlooking them, try finding out what they mean. You could google them or just visit our [Wiki](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/) page on [Deep Learning](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Deep_Learning).

- Exhausted by all the math? Here's an article to get you motivativated - [Applications of CNNs](https://machinelearningmastery.com/applications-of-deep-learning-for-computer-vision/).


### Week 2-3 | Learning Pytorch

- Libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow make implementing neural nets a bliss. PyTorch's [60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) will help you get started. It's recommended that you type your own code as well.

- Hopefully you would have got a clear understanding of what a neural network is. It is now time to tinker around with them to decrease training time, and improve accuracy. Do this course on [Hyperparameter Tuning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning) to know more. You can skip the TensorFlow part if you wish to, since you already got an idea of PyTorch.

- You can now do further PyTorch [tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html). The above course would help you understand these examples better. Make your own [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks and tinker around. It's important to try out various values of hyperparameters for better practical learning.


### Week 4 | Attempting a Kaggle Challenge

- [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset is a large database of handwritten digits. Pytorch has a [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) to train your NN on the MNIST dataset. You can leave the [CNN](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html#switch-to-cnn) part for now.

- Kaggle is a community of data scientists where you can find a vast variety of datasets and competitions to hone your skills. Try attempting this Kaggle Challenge to get started - [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

### Week 5 | CNNs

- Convolutional Neural Networks have been considered revolutionary in processing images. Read either of these articles to get an understanding of how they work - 
	+ [CNN in PyTorch](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/convolutional-neural-networks-tutorial-in-pytorch/)
	+ [CNN in PyTorch (2)](https://algorithmia.com/blog/convolutional-neural-nets-in-pytorch)

- [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is an established computer-vision dataset. Attempt a related challenge on Kaggle - [Object Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10).

- Try implementing CNN models for classification problems on your own. This article will guide you as to how you can [Create your own dataset](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-your-own-image-dataset-for-deep-learning-b53f1c22c443).
